=====[SCALING]===========================================================

===[HORIZONTAL]==============================================================

=> BUYING MORE SERVER MACHINES TO HANDLE REQUESTS

PROS
=> RESILIENT AND CAN TOLERATE IF A SINGLE 
MACHINE FAILS BECAUSE THE OTHER MACHINES 
WILL ACT AS BACKUP
=> SCALES WELL AS USERS INCREASE

CONS
=> LOAD BALANCING IS REQUIRED
=> INCONSISTENT MAINTENANCE OF DATA BECAUSE
DATA IS BEING TRANSMITTED BETWEEN MACHINES 
AND THERE IS A RISK OF DATA LOSS
=> SLOW DATA COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE 
INDIVIDUAL MACHINES VIA NETWORK CALLS (RPC)

RPC => REMOTE PROCEDURE CALL

RPC IS USED WHEN A PROGRAM WANTS TO REQUEST 
A SERVICE FROM ANOTHER PROGRAM THAT IS 
LOCATED IN ANOTHER COMPUTER ON THE SAME NETWORK


===[VERTICAL]===============================================================

=> BUYING A BIGGER SERVER TO HANDLE REQUESTS
=> AIMS TO OPTIMIZE PROCESSES AND INCREASE 
THROUGHPUT WITHOUT CHANGING RESOURCES

PROS
=> FAST INTER PROCESS DATA COMMUNICATION
=> CONSISTENT MAINTENANCE OF DATA BECAUSE 
ALL DATA RESIDES IN A SINGLE LOCATION

CONS
=> SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE SINCE ALL OF THE 
DATA RESIDES IN THAT SINGLE LOCATION
=> HARDWARE LIMITATIONS DUE TO INCREASED SIZE
