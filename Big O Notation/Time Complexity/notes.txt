=====[TIME COMPLEXITY]===========================================================

O(1) => CONSTANT TIME
=> RUNTIME REMAINS CONSTANT DESPITE 
THE SIZE OF THE INPUT DATASET
EX. 1 => RETRIEVING DATA FROM AN ARRAY

O(n) => LINEAR TIME
=> THE NUMBER OF OF OPERATIONS AND HENCE, 
THE RUNTIME OF THE ALGORITHM IS LINEARLY 
PROPORTIONAL TO THE SIZE OF THE INPUT DATASET
EX. 1 => RETRIEVING DATA FROM A LINKED LIST
EX. 2 => LOOPING THROUGH AN ARRAY

O(n^2) => QUADRATIC TIME
=> AS THE THE SIZE OF THE INPUT DATASET 
GROWS, THE NUMBER OF OF OPERATIONS AND HENCE, 
THE RUNTIME OF THE ALGORITHM GROWS 
QUADRATICALLY
=> VERY BAD

O(logn) => LOGARITHMIC TIME
=> AS THE THE SIZE OF THE INPUT DATASET 
GROWS THE NUMBER OF OF OPERATIONS AND HENCE, 
THE RUNTIME OF THE ALGORITHM GROWS 
LOGARITHMICALLY

O(n!) => WORSE CASE SCENARIO

O(sqrt(n))
