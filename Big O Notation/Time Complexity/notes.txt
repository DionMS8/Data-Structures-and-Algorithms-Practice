=====[TIME COMPLEXITY]===========================================================

O(1) => CONSTANT TIME
=> RETRIEVING DATA FROM AN ARRAY

O(n)
=> IT IS CONSIDERED LINEAR BECAUSE THE 
NUMBER OF OF OPERATIONS (COMPLEXITY) IS 
PROPORTIONAL TO THE SIZE OF THE DATASET
EX. 1 => RETRIEVING DATA FROM A LINKED LIST
EX. 2 => LOOPING THROUGH AN ARRAY

O(n^2) => LINEAR TIME
=> VERY BAD

O(n!) => WORSE CASE SCENARIO

O(logn) => LOGARITHMIC TIME

O(sqrt(n))
